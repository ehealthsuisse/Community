## Netiquette
Before we finally get down to the discussion, a refresher on the rules of communication. Write in the discussion as if the person were face to face with you. Act as if you were having a face-to-face discussion with the person posting. In this way, you also avoid violating copyrights, because you wouldn't disclose your work documents to a wildfire person. Just as you would not publish your personal data (phone, address, email, etc.) or that of others On this platform, we do not tolerate bullying or advertising. Users treat each other with respect and remain objective and polite. Since we want a qualitative discussion, we mark the quotes and check our sources.
